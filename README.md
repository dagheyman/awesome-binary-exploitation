*WIP, PRs always welcome. Goal is to collect resources on binary exploitation, with focus on beginner-friendly stuff. :)*

## Lab environments and excercises

**Exploit Exercises (Protostar, Nebola, etc.)** [Mirror](https://exploit.education), [Video walkthrough](https://old.liveoverflow.com/binary_hacking/protostar/index.html)  
exploit-exercises.com provides a variety of virtual machines, documentation and challenges that can be used to learn about a variety of computer security issues such as privilege escalation, vulnerability analysis, exploit development, debugging, reverse engineering, and general cyber security issues.

[**Nightmare**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/index.html)   
Nightmare is an intro to binary exploitation / reverse engineering course based around ctf challenges. I call it that because it's a lot of people's nightmare to get hit by weaponized 0 days, which these skills directly translate into doing that type of work (plus it's a really cool song).

## Wargames
[**Pwnable.kr**](https://pwnable.kr/)  
'pwnable.kr' is a non-commercial wargame site which provides various pwn challenges regarding system exploitation. the main purpose of pwnable.kr is 'fun'. please consider each of the challenges as a game. while playing pwnable.kr, you could learn/improve system hacking skills but that shouldn't be your only purpose.

## Books
[**Hacking The Art of Exploitation**](https://nostarch.com/hacking2.htm) [**[Live-CD]**](https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9781593271442/raw/master/hacking-live-1.0.iso) (2008)   
Rather than merely showing how to run existing exploits, author Jon Erickson explains how arcane hacking techniques actually work. To share the art and science of hacking in a way that is accessible to everyone, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition introduces the fundamentals of C programming from a hacker's perspective.
